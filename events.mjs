      "description": "GREEN: Prepare a five-minute tale involving verdant fields, blades of grass, tree-huggers or leprechauns. The bubbling envy over the childhood friend whose sneakers always shone brighter than yours. Of coveting thy neighbor, or chasing the benjamins. Stories of the unripe and inexperienced. The time when nature nurtured you, or when you were lost in the forest at nightfall with no flashlight. The grass is always, well… you know.",

      "description": "Prepare a five-minute story about being nosy. Eavesdropping, meddling and sneaking around. Seemingly harmless questions or internet stalking. Flipping through a sibling's diary, hiring a private eye, or peeking at someone's browser history. Intrusive neighbors, overnight stake outs, or facial recognition surveillance. Or, tell us about your own prying and spying. Mind your own business!",
